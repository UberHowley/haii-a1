    "# Home Loan Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this task is to build a predictive machine learning classifier that will use historic data of loan decisions (ground truth) to make recommended decisions for new loan applications. Along the way, you’ll get comfortable with using Jupyter Notebooks to document your work, using scikit-learn to train and test basic ML models, and start thinking about the strengths and weaknesses of models like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset `home_loans_sample.csv` a listing of home loan applications in Washington, USA, where each row of the dataset is an individual loan application. Your goal in this assignment is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a given loan application was accepted or rejected. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "In the US (and a number of other countries), it is common for people who want to buy a home to apply for a loan (called a “mortgage”) from a bank or other lender. In order for the bank to decide whether to give them this loan, the bank will look at a number of factors to determine whether they are likely to be able to repay the loan because the bank does not want to lend money to somebody who would not be able to pay it back. These factors typically include how much money the person makes, how much money they are asking for in the loan, and a handful of other things.  Banks typically have formulas in place to determine who they will approve for a given loan and who they will deny, but there is also frequently some human judgment involved in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the person is approved for the loan, they will use the loan to purchase the home and will pay it back in small chunks every month for a set period of time (usually 15 or 30 years). If they are denied, they may have to find a less expensive home to buy or address some of the factors that led them to be denied (e.g., they might have to wait until they make more money). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we are given a set of data about whether customers were approved or denied a loan based on a number of factors. In this assignment, your job will be to build a model that predicts whether a person will be approved or denied based on these same factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Data Exploration\n",
    "The first few exercises will get you used to looking at the data using `pandas`. Pandas is a widely used library in python for manipulating data. Why? Datasets can consume a _lot_ of space in your computer's memory and traditional python data structures like lists or dictionaries will become painfully slow as we add thousands of rows of data. We use a specialized dataset library `pandas` which has a specialized data structure called a `dataframe` designed to be ultra fast & efficient.
