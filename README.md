# Assignment #1 Setup Instructions

## Step #1 Install Anaconda
Anaconda will have all the libraries (scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy) as well as Jupyter notebooks that we will use in this assignment. Follow the instructions to install on your machine here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

(If you already have Anaconda installed, please ensure it is up to date!)
This is written assuming use of Python 3.6 or greater.

## Step #2 Download homework files
Download the `ipynb` notebook file in this repository as well as `data.zip`. Place both of these files into a well-named folder on your computer, and click on the zip file to unzip the data folder. Rename the `.ipynb` file to `[yourunix]_haii24a[assignmentnumber]`, e.g., `ikh1_haii24a1`. You will submit this file to Glow when completed.

## Step #3 (Terminal Option)
In your terminal, navigate to your homework folder and run `jupyter notebook .` to start the notebook. A notebook session should open up in your browser.

## Step #3 (Graphical User Interface Option)
Once Anaconda is installed on your machine, open an application called Anaconda-Navigator. On the main page, click the 'launch' button on the Jupyter Notebook tile. A notebook session should open up in your browser.

# Jupyter Notebooks
If you haven't used Jupyter Notebooks before, then read the [Jupyter Notebook Tutorial: The Definitive Guide](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook) and take the User Interface Tour in the Jupyter notebook Help menu once you've opened your first Jupyter Notebook.

On a Mac, you can run a Jupyter notebook from Terminal by typing `jupyter notebook name_of_file_here.ipynb`. On Windows, you will do [something similar](https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/opening-a-jupyter-notebook-on-windows.html) but by running the 'Anaconda Prompt' that comes with the Anaconda distribution.
